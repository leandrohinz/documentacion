Sure, here are the steps to merge a develop branch into the master branch in Git:

First, switch to the master branch:
git checkout master

Then, merge the develop branch into the master branch:
git merge develop

If there are any merge conflicts, you’ll need to resolve them. Once you’ve resolved all conflicts, you can commit the merge:
git commit -m "Merged develop into master"

Finally, push your changes to the remote repository:
git push origin master

Please note that it’s a good practice to ensure that your local master branch is up-to-date with the remote master branch before performing the merge. You can do this by pulling the latest changes from the remote master branch before the merge:

git pull origin master
